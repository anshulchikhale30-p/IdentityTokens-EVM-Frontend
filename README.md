# Mini DIT Prototype – Frontend 

⚠️ This is a **1-week experimental frontend prototype**, built as part of my **DIT 2026 preparation**.

This repository is **forked from StabilityNexus/IdentityTokens-EVM-Frontend** and is **not a production-ready implementation**.

---

## Goal
To prototype a **minimal frontend interface** for interacting with **Decentralized Identity Tokens (DIT)** smart contracts, focusing on usability and clarity rather than completeness.

This frontend is inspired by ideas from:
- **TNT (Trust Network Tokens)**
- **VouchMe (On-chain testimonials)**

---

## Scope (Intentionally Small)
- Wallet connection (MetaMask / injected providers)
- Minting self-issued identity tokens
- Viewing owned identity tokens
- Creating on-chain endorsements between identities
- Revoking endorsements
- Displaying basic identity metadata

---

## Non-Goals
- Full DID UX flows
- Advanced privacy or ZK interfaces
- Off-chain identity verification
- Production-grade UI/UX polish

---

## Status
🚧 **Work in progress**  
This is a short-term learning prototype built in parallel with the smart-contract exploration.

---

## Relation to DIT 2026
This frontend complements the **Mini DIT smart-contract prototype** and supports exploration of the proposed **Decentralized Identity Tokens (DIT)** direction before the GSoC proposal phase.

The goal is to demonstrate:
- Understanding of the project domain
- Ability to prototype end-to-end systems
- Thoughtful scoping and experimentation
